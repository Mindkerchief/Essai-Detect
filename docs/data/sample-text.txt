Millimeter wave is the band of spectrum between 30 GHz and 300 GHz. The band of spectrum below 6 GHz is full of data traffic causing a major interruption. Many different devices and technology like Radio, Television, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular Tower, Smartphones, Smartwatch, Drones and so much more are interrupting the space with their own different band of spectrum. Those wireless devices are sending data to the air along with the thousands other devices making a data traffic just like in the road.
This problem can be solve by opening a new range of frequency and it can be anywhere between 6 to 300 GHz. In this way, the data traffic below 6 GHz can be lessen because some devices will go to a higher frequency which is the Millimeter Wave. But still there is still a problem when it comes signal distribution. Signals send by the high-power cellular tower can be weaken or totally block by any solid infrastructure like buildings and more probably it can be absorb by plants and water.

We arrive at school with some pupils cleaning inside our workplace, their laugh is so incent that makes me feel like I sometimes want to go back to my childhood days. On the other hand, I first fix the unprofessional wiring of my team on the clients because it looks really messy. Patayan test the monitor if it's all working but there is one that we can't turn on. We try to remove the power cord but it is so tight that even Ma'am Malou can't unplug and then after we remove the device at the back of the monitor, it surprisingly become more lose and it is now working. It is a strange phenomena that even I can't imagine what happen. Ma'am Malou said that maybe some spirits is making fun of us.
By the way, I have now the password for that last archive file and I find out that it is an updated version of the program we are trying to run. There is actually no license inside it but I still replace the already installed Vspace with this new version to see if it works. After using the updated program, it matches to the GUI on those tutorial I watch yesterday. Now, it all make sense. I try to go back and follow everything but at the end, I still failed because the program just duplicate its display and didn't show the logon screen.
I stop for a while to focus on another task because we are going to move the server near the clients but the ethernet cable length is not enough so we buy a 25 meter long Cat 5e UTP cable and some RJ45. We don't know where we can buy a keystone jack so we don't go for it. Pornia and others are busy fixing those busted USB cable all this time and then Pornia request to let her do the crimping so I let her do it but it is rejected so now we only have two RJ45 for a 25 meter UTP cable. I have to do this right this time because we don't have any excess RJ45 and I made it first try. It was my first time crimping a 25-meter long Ethernet cable and it is also going to used as a permanent wiring so I am happy with my current skill. That Ethernet cable ended up to be a little short so Ma'am show us her old router and I was shocked because we can just used that to avoid buying a new Ethernet cable. We ended up to replacing the old cable and use it for the server.

Today, another difficult job was assign to us. It is to setup the Interactive Projector. It is new to me and my team so we are having difficulty setting it up. We ended up leaving it for tommorow as there are many teachers asking for help for their laptop and desktop computer. I let my team to perform the job since they insist so I just check and assist to the quality of their work. I'm also busy finalizing all the files needed to be backup before formatting the laptop. We succesfully worked on three computers today. The two desktop computers we troubleshoot decided to leaved in this room.

We didn't finish the 4th computer since backing-up 50+ gigabytes of files takes a lot of time. Teachers seems amaze on our skills. It is my most productive day so far.

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence breaks down the term AI we know today. AI is a technology that learns through data, finds pattern then generate results from it without human intervention. There are three levels of AI, the Narrow, Broad and General AI. Narrow and Broad AI is currently integrated to most of our Internet activities while General AI is what we are currently pursuing. General AI has intelligence capable at the level close to us human. It is believed to do most things we can like being creative and has awareness.
AI learns either through supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement. The data they analyze can be structured, semi-structured and unstructured. Currently, around 80% of the world’s data are unstructured, that is why most big company are focusing on the way to analyze unstructured data.

AI can be a powerful tool but it can also be a dangerous specially when a specific task is dependent on the result of an AI. To prevent this unwanted outcomes, we must follow the five ethics in AI: the fairness, robustness, explainability, transparency and privacy.
Fairness is the prevention of unwanted bias in the results. It can be something that gain benefit for being in a particular group. 
Robustness is the prevention of being taken advantage its vulnerabilities. The model can be influence during training and also during deployment. An adversarial attack happens when the adversary exploits the vulnerabilities of the system. It can be through poisoning of dataset and evasion of model test.
Explainability is the process how AI comes up with its prediction in a detailed way. Interpretability on the other hand is how normal user can understand how a system probably works that it makes sense based on their activities.
Transparency is the availability of the information how the AI system is created in different form. It can be description of the dataset and model or what is the business operation compose of.
Privacy is the proper usage of data set used to train the model. Data set must be limited to what are actually relevant to make accurate prediction. Personal sensitive information should be removed or at least anonymize to hide obvious results that lead to specific person.

The logical topology will implement a hybrid network with three separate VLANs for guest, loyalty program members and for administrative use. The guest network will provide open access with bandwidth limits to ensure fair usage, while the loyalty network will offer WPA3 password-protected Wi-Fi with higher priority and higher bandwidth. The administrative VLAN will securely connects essential systems like brewing stations, point-of-sale devices and other supported technology.
High-quality hardware will be used, including a Cisco RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Router for dual-WAN redundancy, managed switches with Power over Ethernet (PoE) capabilities. And Ubiquiti UniFi U7-Pro access points for reliable wireless coverage over 140m², tri-radio with Wi-Fi 7 supports, over 300 client device limit and with Power over Ethernet (PoE) capabilities as well. Because of the APs very wide range, just two of this APs will be strategically placed in 1st and 3rd floor to ensure consistent connectivity and minimize interference through proper channel planning. Even on outage of one of the AP, a single AP can still be accessed throughout the building and capable of handling more than 200 devices.

Navigating daily life can be challenging for individuals with visual impairments, especially within their own homes. Traditional smart home systems often rely on visual interfaces, limiting accessibility and independence. To address these challenges, we propose the Smart Sunglass Assistant, an innovative wearable solution that enhances mobility, object awareness, and smart home interaction through real-time object detection, auditory guidance, and haptic feedback.
Equipped with AI-powered vision and context-aware automation, this smart eyewear assists users in identifying obstacles, confirming household object statuses (e.g., whether a faucet is running or a door is open), and integrating with smart home devices for hands-free control. Additionally, the system features a walking cane tracking capability, ensuring the user remains oriented and informed about their environment.
By combining Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles with cutting-edge assistive technology, the Smart Sunglass Assistant aims to provide visually impaired individuals with greater autonomy, safety, and confidence in their daily routines. This application serves as a step toward a more inclusive future, where smart home accessibility is no longer a challenge but a seamless, intuitive experience.

The C4001 sensor offers flexibility in communication, supporting both UART and I2C interfaces. DFRobot provides an Arduino library, facilitating straightforward integration and programming with Arduino boards. This library allows users to configure the sensor's parameters, set detection ranges, sensitivity levels, and retrieve processed data such as motion detection status, distance, and speed measurements. 
DFRobot Wiki
Regarding access to raw data, the C4001 sensor primarily provides processed output data through its interfaces. While it offers detailed information like distance and speed measurements, it does not grant direct access to unprocessed raw signal data. This design simplifies the sensor's integration and use but limits the ability to perform custom signal processing or develop bespoke detection algorithms. For applications requiring raw data access, alternative sensors that explicitly offer this capability would be more suitable.
In summary, the DFRobot C4001 mmWave sensor is a versatile and user-friendly module for human presence and motion detection applications. Its ease of integration and robust performance make it a strong candidate for various projects, provided that access to raw signal data is not a critical requirement.
